r/next-tick
r/wrap
The new wrap function combines two parts – a simple value, and a callback for when that value should change – into one value, that happens to look as an atom.

The first argument to wrap should be the value that will be returned by @the-result.

The second argument should be a function, that will be passed the new value whenever the result is changed (with optional extra arguments to wrap prepended, as with partial).


`reagent.core/cursor`

Values and references
So what’s the difference between wraps and cursors? Why have both?

A wrap is just a value that happens to look like an atom. It doesn’t change unless you tell it to. It is a very lightweight combination of value and a callback to back-propagate changes to the value. It relies only on Reagent’s equality test in :should-component-update to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.

A cursor, on the other hand, will always be up-to-date with the value of the source atom. In other words, it acts a reference to part of the value of the source. Components that deref cursors are re-rendered automatically, in exactly the same way as if they deref a normal Reagent atom (unnecessary re-rendering is avoided by checking if the cursor's value has changed using identical?).
